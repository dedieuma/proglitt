# Mini-Projet

The Mini-Projet has to be developed in *groups of two students*.

## Datasets

List where data sets have to be chosen from:

- FR Data.gouv: https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/
- Insee: https://www.insee.fr/fr/accueil
- Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets
- US Data.gov: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset


## Guidelines

1. Justify the data set selection and described it
2. Formulate three questions about the selected data set
3. Discuss with the professors and choose one question among these
4. Propose a methodology to answer that question
5. Implement this methodology using Literate Programming
6. The report must be acessible online (in your git repository)

## Report

The R Markdown (to be written in RStudio) must contain:

- Frontpage
  - _Title_
  - Student's name
- Table of contents
- Introduction
  - Context / Dataset description
    - How the dataset has been obtained?
  - Description of the question
- Methodology
  - Data clean-up procedures
  - Scientific workflow
  - Data representation choices
- Analysis in Literate Programming
- Conclusion
- References

## Important notes

The question might be from simple to complex. More the question is
simple, more deep should be the analysis.
